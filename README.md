## My process

Tried to complete this challenge without referencing on YouTube or github. Took longer than expected due to researching how to create/change accordion without any JS. Also had to change the design several times to make it responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- No Javascript

### What I learned

New HTML tags and CSS selectors, positioning with position/transform.
